# floridaman-headlines

Get Florida Man headlines for no reason! Uses [floridaman.com](https://floridaman.com/) to fetch data.

## Get this working

Run the following in your desired terminal:

```shell
$ npm install
$ npm run start

It creates a `finetune.txt` file which contains all the headlines.

**Enjoy!**
